-   Evaluated monitoring solutions from vendors to monitor the
    infrastructure supporting the BBC’s online presence
-   Designed solution for monitoring BBC infrastructure using open
    source technologies
-   Provided log management solution for Riverbed Stingray load
    balancers using Fluentd and S3
-   Member of team designing new BBC CDN origin service
    -   Design and implementation of monitoring solution
    -   Focused on performance
-   Member of DevOPs team implementing and supporting log management for
    the BBC’s AWS estate

BBC Future Media provide the technology behind all of the BBC’s online
presence. I was brought into a small team to investigate potential
replacements for the current monitoring solution. After evaluation of
products from 3 vendors the decision was made to implement a monitoring
solution from open source components along the lines of the work I had
done at Liz Earle. Our team was later merged with another to
provide a monitoring solution for the new CDN in development by BBC R&D.
In this merger I took on more responsibilities working on a Log
management infrastructure for the BBC’s considerable AWS estate using
Elasticsearch and Flume.

    threats

The Liz Earle eCommerce site is a fork of Magento running on Debian. In
my tenure I successfully simplified and scaled up the infrastructure. I
have also introduced configuration management Puppet and OpenVZ
container build automation using Ansible. Magento is very database heavy
and has required much tuning of the Percona MySQL infrastructure along
with careful implementation of caching technologies. I was also
responsible for managing the Development, Test and Staging
infrastructures, the Jenkins CI pipeline along with some internal
business systems.

-   Managed the VVNT Test Team's IT infrastructure

    automations
-   Joined Core MIS team, managing production infrastructure in addition
    to Test team infrastructure

I joined Micromuse as the Systems Administrator responsible for the VVNT
Test network. The VVNT network was used by the Test team to validate new
software provided by Development and to confirm bugs reported by
customers. As such my workload was split between providing test
resources for on going planned projects and providing resources at very
short notice when a large customer reported a bug. As the company grew I
was transferred to the core administration team where I kept my existing
responsibilities and took on new core (email, network, directory,
backup) responsibilities.
